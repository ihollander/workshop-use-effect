# Cleaning Up

## Overview

One part of our component's journey that we haven't covered is "what happens to
our component when we no longer are displaying it"?

We can visualize the lifecycle of our component like this:

When React first runs our app's code, our components are _born_ onto the page:
React calls our component functions; figures out what JSX they return; and turns
that JSX into some DOM elements that are then _rendered_ in the browser.

After they are rendered, React calls any _side effects_ that we set up in our
components using the `useEffect` hook. In the previous example, this is where
our `fetch` code runs.

While our components are _living_ on the page, we can update their data by
_setting state_. Whenever we set state in a component, that cause our component
(and all of its children) to _re-render_. After the components have re-rendered,
React will call our _side effects_ again. (It will also run the side effects
cleanup function, but we'll save that for later!)

When using the `useEffect` hook for long-running actions, like an event listener
on the window, or subscription to a Websocket, or a timer running in the
background, it's useful to be able to _clean up_ the code when we are no longer
using it.

In React, we can perform this clean up by _returning a function_ from the
`useEffect` callback:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Side effect function");

  return () => {
    console.log("Cleanup function");
  };
});
```

As you can see from the diagram above, the function to "Cleanup Old Side
Effects" will run on a couple of occasions:

- Before running the side effect function (if we update state, the cleanup
  function will run before the side effect)
- When our component _unmounts_ (when it is no longer being returned by a parent
  component)

Here's an example of using the cleanup function to remove an event listener:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  function handleEvent(event) {
    setMouseX(event.target.clientX);
  }

  window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleEvent);

  return function cleanup() {
    window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleEvent);
  };
});
```

One important reason to clean up after our effects is so that our code isn't
running in the background and using up resources unnecessarily! React will also
typically warn about the need for cleaning up after side effects if you are
setting state in an unmounted component:

## Exercise

In the exercise, we have a `Clock` component that displays the current date and
time. To keep the clock up to date, we set up an interval to run every 1 second
using `setInterval`, where we trigger an update to state with the new time.

However, sometimes we don't want to show the `Clock` component to our users! We
can toggle the clock on and off by clicking the button, which will
_conditionally render_ the `Clock` component.

_When the Clock component unmounts_, we want to stop the interval from running
by using
[`clearInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval),
so we aren't wasting resources by running the interval in the background.

Use the cleanup function for the `useEffect` callback to clear the interval!

> Make sure you have your console open as you're working, so that you can see
> when state is being updated. The desired behavior is that when the clock is no
> longer being displayed, you will no longer see "Setting state" in the console.
