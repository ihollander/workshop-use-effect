# useEffect Dependencies

In the last exercise, we saw how to use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from
an API _as soon as the component first rendered_, without any kind of event
(like clicking a button) triggering the fetch request.

One way to think about this interaction is by thinking about _synchronizing side
effects with our component_.

To see an example of how this synchronization works, check out the code below
(also included in the `exercise/02.js` file for you):

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Running side effect");
  });

  console.log("Rendering component");

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count + 1)}>{count}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Every time our component renders (during the initial render, as well as any time
it re-renders based on any state changing), you'll see in the console:

- `Rendering component`
- `Running side effects`

_However_, in the first exercise, this isn't the same behavior we saw with
`useEffect`! That's due to the second argument we gave to `useEffect`: the
_dependencies array_:

```js
useEffect(
  // side effect function
  () => {
    console.log("Running side effect");
  },
  // dependencies array
  []
);
```

The dependencies array lets us control _what state_ the side effect code
_depends on_. You can think of it as a way to _synchronize our effects with
state_.

- When we _don't_ include a dependencies array, our side effect will run _every
  time the component renders_
- When the dependencies array is _empty_, the side effect will only run _once_
- When we put _variables_ into the dependencies array, the side effect will run
  _any time those variables change between renders_

Put another way:

For example, if we change our component like so:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Running side effect");
    console.log("Count is:", count);
  }, [count]);

  console.log("Rendering component");

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count + 1)}>{count}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The side effect code will only run when the `count` state changes; but it won't
run when the `text` state changes. Our `useEffect` function is now
_synchronized_ to our `text` state!

## Exercise

One nice feature we can implement in our forms is the ability to save a user's
work so that they can recover if they accidentally refresh the page, or navigate
away, while they're in the middle of filling it out. A common way this kind of
feature is implemented is by using
[`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage),
which is a tool built into the browser for persisting data. It works like this:

```js
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
localStorage.getItem("key"); // => "value"
```

In the exercise, we want to use `localStorage` to save the `text` state from our
component whenever that state is updated by using the `useEffect` hook.

You'll also need to change the initial state for the `text` to read that value
from `localStorage` if there's a previous value saved.

You can check if your solution works by typing something into the input field
and refreshing the page &mdash; when the page reloads, you should still see your
value!

If you haven't worked with `localStorage` before, make sure to check out the
[MDN docs on using `localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

Good luck!

### Extra Credit

If calculating initial state is computationally expensive, or can be better
expressed using a function, there's another syntax you can use known as
[lazy initial state](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initial-state):

```js
const initialState = () => doExpensiveComputationThatReturnsAValue();
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

By passing a _function_ rather than a _value_ to `useState`, we can potentially
optimize our state initialization. Check out
[this blog by Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-state-lazy-initialization-and-function-updates#usestate-lazy-initialization)
for more examples.

As a bonus, try to use the lazy initial state syntax when setting up your
initial state to read from `localStorage`!
