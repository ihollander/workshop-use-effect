# Fixing Dependencies

## Overview

Using the dependencies array correctly is one of the trickiest parts of the
`useEffect` hook. Thankfully, there's a simple rule to follow that will help you
use it right 100% of the time:

_If a variable from your component is being used in the useEffect hook, put that
variable in the dependencies array!_

For example, in this version, we're not using the dependencies correctly:

```js
const [title, setTitle] = useState("Welcome to my webpage");

useEffect(() => {
  document.title = title;
}, []);
```

The `title` variable is a dependency for our effect: the code in our hook needs
to know what that variable is, and should also run when ever that variable
changes! We need to add it to our dependencies array:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = title;
}, [title]); // added to the array
```

Luckily for us, there's even a built-in
[linting rule](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/react-hooks-pitfalls#pitfall-2-not-using-or-ignoring-the-eslint-plugin)
in create-react-app that will give a warning if you don't specify your
dependencies correctly:

A few things to keep in mind when you're working with the dependencies:

- Functions count as dependencies too! If you've got code that looks like this:

```js
function fetchData() {
  getData().then(setState);
}

useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

You can either add `fetchData` as a dependency:

```js
function fetchData() {
  getData().then(setState);
}

useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, [fetchData]);
```

...or write the function inside the `useEffect` instead:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  function fetchData() {
    getData().then(setState);
  }
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

Or, if you want to get into some advanced hooks, take a look at the
[useCallback hook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L59rOas2AYE)!

- React uses `===` to compare the dependencies from the current render with the
  dependencies from the previous render, so using _objects_ and _arrays_ as
  dependencies will cause your `useEffect` code to run on every re-render. If
  you only want to re-render when a specific property of an object changes, it's
  better to use the property as a dependency instead of the whole object:

```js
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  name: "",
  id: 1,
});

useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`url?search=${formData.name}`)
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(setData);
  // use only the properties you need as dependencies
}, [formData.name]);
```

## Exercise

In the exercise, we're fetching a random cat image with from the
[CATAAS (Cat as a service) API](https://cataas.com/#/).

The code for fetching data is written in a `useEffect` function, and we can
successfully fetch an image when the page first loads. However, we should _also_
be able to fetch an image when the form is submitted, and the `text` or `filter`
state in the `App` component is updated.

You don't have to write too much code to get this working! Just fix the warning
message related to the dependencies array, and you're good to go.

> NOTE: even though we are using the `useEffect` to fetch data "after" a form
> submits, you don't always need to follow this approach! You can also write
> your fetch code in the event handler directly. The reason for using
> `useEffect` in this example is because we want to initiate a fetch request _as
> soon as the component loads_, as well as _anytime the text or filter state
> changes_. If we only wanted to fetch data when the form submits, we could
> approach this problem differently.
